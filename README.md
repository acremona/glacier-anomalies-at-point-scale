# real-time glacier mass changes

Test project with the Mean shift algorithm.

This is only a first try to see how tracking algorithms works. 
At the moment the code has been tested only on this two images and it worked (but they are very clear images, We have to test if it works with images with worser conditions as well).
The initialization of the track window is manually made... which is a problem since we have to analyze a large nember of images, we have to find a way to make it automatically somehow...
I dont know if Mean shift is the best algorithm to do our task, but as said is only a first attempt. Maybe we find more suitable algorithms!
